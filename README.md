# yellow-car-project
my first project(not ready yet)
a horror game in development. Two players spawn in a scary parking lot, in which they have to find the yellow car out of all the cars and drive it to run over the other player, while the other player has to escape the lot through the door that spawns when a player interacts with the car. So far, the multiplayer isn't ready yet, and the running over other player too.
